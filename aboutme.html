        Hi, I'm Cian Wescott and I'm a Computer Science major at Marywood University. 
        I like playing chess, hiking, and hanging out with my friends.

        My favorite hobby is gaming. I started playing video games since before I knew how to read. 
        Now I mostly only have time to play Rivals and CS with my friends ever so often. 
        My favorite game is Hollow Knight, but Enter the Gungeon, Hunt: Showdown, and Hades are great too. Video games are the main reason 
        I got into programming in the first place.
